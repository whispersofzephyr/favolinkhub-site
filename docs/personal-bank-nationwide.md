| **$2,500** | $250,000+ | 3 full calendar months |

- **Bring New Money within 30 days of account opening**
- **Maintain the qualifying balance for 3 full calendar months** after account opening

- Premier Checking  
- Savings  
- Premier Relationship Savings  
- Self-Directed Brokerage (**ACAT OK**)  
- CDs (6 / 12 / 24 months)

**Account strategy (important):**  

- Self-Directed Brokerage is **best if you ACAT assets**  
- For **cash deposits**, most users keep funds in:
  
    - **Self-Directed Brokerage sweep**, or  
    - **Premier Relationship Savings**  
    so you can earn competitive interest during the 3-month holding period

  *(See Editor’s Notes below for details.)*

### 🧭 How to Get Your $1,500 or $2,500 Bonus (Step-by-Step)

1. Open **Premier Checking** using the referral link
     
     - You may select Premier Relationship Savings during application, but it can also be added later  
     - Brokerage must be applied for **after** Checking is open
     
2. Open Savings / Brokerage / CDs as needed
3. Deposit **a few dollars into Checking** to prevent account closure
4. Deposit or ACAT **$100k or $250k+** into:
   
     - Premier Relationship Savings, and/or  
     - Self-Directed Brokerage, and/or  
     - CDs  
   (any combination is allowed)

5. **Maintain the qualifying balance for 3 full calendar months** after account opening
6. Receive **$1,500 or $2,500**, typically deposited into Checking **in 1-2 months** after the holding period ends

### 💡 Editor’s Notes

- **Premier Relationship Savings — Intro Relationship APY (important):**

    - When you open a **Premier Relationship Savings** account and link it to an open **Premier Checking** account, you automatically receive the **Relationship APY (~3.30% APY, current rate as of 1/17/2026, subject to change)** for:
  
        - The remainder of the current month, **plus**
        - The **following 3 full months**
        - 👉 Effectively, you get **up to 4 months** of the Relationship APY **with no qualification required**.

    - **After the introductory period:**  
  To continue earning the Relationship APY, you must meet **at least ONE** of the following **in the previous month** to earn the Relationship APY in the next month:
      
        - Spend **$500+** using HSBC debit cards  
        - Pay **$500+** to HSBC credit cards from your Premier Checking  
        - Receive **$5,000+** in qualifying third-party direct deposits to Premier Checking    *DPs suggest a $5k external ACH often works as DD; YMMV.*

   - **Brokerage option (no trading required):**
     
      - If you place no trades, funds in Self-Directed Brokerage automatically sweep into:
        
        - **HGDXX** — HSBC Investor U.S. Government Money Market Fund  
          *(7-day yield ~3.39% as of 01/01/2026)*  
        - **HTDXX** — HSBC U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund  
          *(7-day yield ~3.37% as of 01/01/2026)*
        - You can choose between the two sweep options.
  
      - These typically yield **on par with or higher than Relationship Savings**, and:

        - Require **no DD or debit spend**
        - Offer **state tax advantages** due to Treasury exposure

            - 2024 exempt rates: **52.55% (HGDXX)**, **100% (HTDXX)**
            - This often makes Brokerage the preferred option for high-tax state residents.

- **Trading fee:**
  
    - Stocks / ETFs / mutual funds: **$10.99 per online trade**
    - Bonds / T-Bills: phone order with CUSIP, **$35 per order**

- **$50/monthly fee and how to waive:**

    - Waived with **$100,000+ combined balance**, or  
    - Waived with **$5,000 monthly direct deposit**
    - During the promo, the fee is automatically waived since the **minimum promo balance is $100k**.  

      After completing the bonus and moving funds out, simply push **$5k ACH per month** from an external bank to avoid the fee.

      *If you forget one month and are charged the fee, contacting customer service usually results in a **one-time courtesy refund**.*

- **Funds may move during the maintenance period**  
  As long as the **combined balance** does not drop below the required tier.

- **Do NOT zero out Checking**  
  Some DPs report bonus failures when Premier Checking is closed due to a $0 balance.  
  Always keep a small balance in Checking.
