- Premier Savings relationship rate can be **3.30% APY** (as of 12/31/2025) if prior month has **$5,000 direct deposit** or **$500 debit spend** (DPs suggest a $5k ACH may work as DD; YMMV).
- Self-directed brokerage: $10.99 online trades; fixed income by phone $35/order. Cash sweep options: **HGDXX** / **HTDXX** (state tax advantages reported: 52.55% exempt for HGDXX; 100% exempt for HTDXX in 2024).
- You can move funds between qualified accounts as long as combined balance doesn’t drop during the maintenance period.
- After maintenance, if balance drops below $100k: **$50/mo** fee unless **$5,000/mo DD** (DP: $5k ACH may work).
- Keep some balance in Premier checking (some reports of checking closed at $0 causing bonus issues).
