### ✅ How to Get the $300 Bonus (Step-by-step)

1. **Start your application using the referral link**

     - [Apply here](https://secure.centralbank.net/refer-a-friend/RAF30045597113849)
     - The promo code should **auto-populate** during the application, if not, manually input it in the correct field
     - **Confirm the promo code is entered correctly**

           - **Promo Code:** `RAF30045597113849`
           - This code **must be entered in the _PROMO CODE_ field**
           - **Do NOT enter it in the “Referral Code” field**

   > ℹ️ *Important:*  
   > Although some pages mention a “Referral Code” format, in practice the referral **works through the Promo Code field**.  
   > This method has been **tested for years and confirmed by Central Bank customer service**.

2. **Open a new eligible checking account**

     - Free Checking is **not eligible**
     - Deposit **$50 or more at account opening**

3. Make **two or more qualifying direct deposits**

    - **$800 cumulative total**
    - Must post within **90 days** of account opening
 
 4. Keep at least **$50 balance** on day 90

### 📌 Eligibility

- Available to **new-to-bank checking customers only**
- **One bonus per household**
- You may receive **one checking bonus every two years**, measured from the **date the last bonus was paid**
- Not eligible if you had a Central Bank account closed with a **negative balance in the last 2 years**
- Account must be **open and in good standing** when bonus is paid
- Bank reserves the right to deny or close accounts outside its **market area**

### 📝 Notes & Data Points

- **Promo code placement matters:**  
  The referral bonus is triggered by entering the code in the **PROMO CODE** field — **not** the “Referral Code” field.  
  The Promo Code should auto-fill when using the referral link; if it does not, enter it manually.
- **Market-area restriction:** Applicants typically must live within ~50 miles of a Central Bank branch. Accounts opened outside the bank’s market area may be approved initially but later **closed by the bank**.
- **Monthly fee (MyChoice Checking):** $5/month, waived with **$500 direct deposit per statement cycle** or **20 debit card transactions**.
- **Direct deposit:** Real payroll DD appears to be the **safest option**. Some Ally ACH push/pull transactions have reportedly worked, but results are inconsistent.
- **ChexSystems:** Bank **does pull ChexSystems**, but does not appear overly Chex-sensitive based on reported data points.
- **Early account closure fee:** $25 if the account is closed within **90 days** (generally irrelevant since the bonus itself requires a 90-day hold).
- **Advanced tip:** Some users keep a **savings account open ($50 minimum to avoid fees)** after closing checking to maintain an existing relationship and easier future approvals.
